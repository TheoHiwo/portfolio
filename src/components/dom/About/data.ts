  p1: `Hello! I'm Theo, a front-end developer who got captivated by generative arts in mid-2022 and
  decided to embark on a journey of studying front-end development.`,
  p2: `Since then, I've been on an exciting adventure
  of creativity and continuous learning. With love for all things creative, I enjoy exploring new technologies and
  techniques to enhance the user experience and create visually stunning websites. Front-end development allows me
  to blend my artistic inclinations with technical skills.`,
  p3: `Beyond coding, I am fascinated with Japan and its rich culture. Japan's charm inspires me to incorporate elements of elegance and harmony into my work. I'm currently
  learning the Japanese language, and drowning myself in Kanjis. I love learning this language using various modern
  techniques, such as Anki, a software to remember things more quickly, or Yomichan, to search words in the browser
  more efficiently. These are all open-source projects in which I want to play one's part in. In fact, those two
  mentioned apps were the first place where I touched CSS to style for comfort.`,
  p4: `I often play video games. It's a constant source of inspiration,
  reminding me of the potential of interactive experiences and driving me to create captivating digital interactions.`,
  p5: `I'm excited to collaborate with skilled individuals to push my limits and grow while contributing to projects. 
  I'd love to connect if you're looking for a dedicated and versatile
  front-end developer.`,
  p6: `Let's bring your vision to life!`,
